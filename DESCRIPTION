Description: In randomized-controlled trials, interim analyses are often planned for possible early 
   trial termination to claim superiority or futility of a new therapy. Blinded data also have 
   information about the potential treatment difference between the groups. We developed a blinded 
   data monitoring tool that enables investigators to predict whether they observe such an unblinded 
   interim analysis results that supports early termination of the trial. Investigators may skip 
   some of the planned interim analyses if an early termination is unlikely. 
   This tool will provide reference information about N: Sample size at interim analysis, and T: Total 
   number of responders at interim analysis for decision on performing an interim analysis.
